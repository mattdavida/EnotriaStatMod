===== üìã INSTALLATION =====

Requirements:
- UE4SS (Unreal Engine 4 Scripting System): https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases

Installation Steps:
1. **Install UE4SS:** Download and extract the latest UE4SS release into your game's Win64 folder:
   [Your Steam Path]\steamapps\common\Enotria\Enotria\Binaries\Win64\
2. **Download & Extract this Mod:** Extract the mod zip. You will see Enotria/Scripts and shared/Utils folders.
3. **Copy to Mods Folder:** Place the Enotria and shared folders into your Mods directory:
   ...\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\
   Your structure should look like:
   ...\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\Enotria\Scripts\main.lua
   ...\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\shared\Utils\Utils.lua
