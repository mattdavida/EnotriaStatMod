===== 📋 INSTALLATION =====

Requirements:
- UE4SS (Unreal Engine 4 Scripting System): https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases

Installation Steps:
1. **Install UE4SS:** Download and extract the latest UE4SS release into your game's Win64 folder:
   [Your Steam Path]\steamapps\common\Enotria\Enotria\Binaries\Win64\
2. **Download & Extract this Mod:** Extract the mod zip. You will see Enotria/Scripts and shared/Utils folders.
3. **Copy to Mods Folder:** Place the Enotria and shared folders into your Mods directory:
   ...\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\
   Your structure should look like:
   ...\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\Enotria\Scripts\main.lua
   ...\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\shared\Utils\Utils.lua
4. **Enable the Mod:** If required, add Enotria to your mods.txt file:
   ...\Win64\ue4ss\mods.txt
   Add this line:
   Enotria : 1
5. **Launch the Game:** Start Enotria: The Last Song. You'll see mod initialization messages in the UE4SS console.

===== 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING =====
• If hotkeys don't work: Check for mod initialization messages in the UE4SS console
• If game crashes: Double-check your folder structure and UE4SS version
• If stats don't update: Try fast traveling or reloading your character

===== ⚠️ PERFORMANCE & STABILITY =====
This mod uses efficient single-pass processing and works within UE4SS engine boundaries for maximum stability.
The game may crash if commands are used excessively - this is a known limitation of Enotria's engine performance under modding loads.

RECOMMENDED USAGE:
• Use features sparingly to avoid crashes
• Save your game before using mod features
• If experiencing crashes, use "burst mode": enable features → save → disable mod
